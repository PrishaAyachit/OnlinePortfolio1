    <h4> Destination Imagination</h4>
  <p>
    <h5>In third grade I took part in Destination Imagination also known as DI. Here I learned so much that I will never forget. I was in a group with 6 other of my respected classmates.</h5>

        <h5>We decided to take the project of community service. We chose this as we wanted to make a difference. To raise money we made scarves and sold them when we got opportunities during the school year like the holiday craft fair. With the profit made, we packed meals for kids in Kids Against Hunger.</h5>

    <h5>Then came time for the regionals. There we came in first place. With reasonable feeback we were ready to try our hardest in the states. For the state level competion, we had to go to Sacramento. When we went on stage, our goal was to convey the message of helping kids who sleep with an empty stomach. I am very proud of what we did. Though we did not make it to the next round, the globals, I am happy at the effort I put in.</h5>

      <h5>Looking back at this journey, I learned many things. DI gave me an insight on how fortunate I am to have all that I do. Not only that, but it helped me become a more caring and a better person. I have also improved on things like public speaking and presenting because of the practice I got. This project that I took up really impacted my life, and I am very happy with this decision!</h5>
